Q3: You have a class Character with a const member function CalculateDistanceWalked() that uses some data from breadcrumbs to 
determine how far the character has walked since they were created. To save on performance, the team has decided they want to 
cache the distance walked in a member variable and only run the calculation if more than 2 seconds have passed since 
CalculateDistanceWalked last ran its calculation. How would you implement this? Remember, CalculateDistnaceWalked is a const function.
